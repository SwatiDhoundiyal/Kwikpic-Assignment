For building and training a Emotion Detection Model using Face recognition, following steps can be followed:
1. First step is to download a image dataset of Face Emotion recognition.
2. Building a neural network model of image classification in keras.
3. Divide the dataset into two types: Training data and testing data.
4. Reshaping all the training images into a specific size and putting it into the model to train the model.
5. Using image augemntations to improve the model performance.
6. After a satisfying accuracy, save the model.
7. Then testing the model on the test data.
8. Some tuning of the hyperparameters can be done if required.
9. Take the image input and our model will predict the emotion.
10.The model is ready.
